In this class, we will introduce the bootstrap method and its application to learning a predictor called Bagging (Bootstrap AGGregatING). First we review bootstrap in statistics as a method to estimate the variance of an estimator on any statistic of a random variable (e.g. its mean). Then we extend this notion to machine learning, i.e., to learning a predictor for regression or classification. We discuss the pros and cons of bagging.
