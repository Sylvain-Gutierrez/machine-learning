In this class, we will introduce Random Forest as a new boosting machine algorithm using randomness in two ways to incrementally add trees:

- By sub-sampling a random training set in the original training set as in bagging methods.
- By selecting a random subset of features on which performing tree splits for each choice of split.

The method is then showcased in simple classification tasks.
